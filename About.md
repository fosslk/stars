This is a program to evaluate and offer points for Campus clubs in collaboration with FOSS.LK

### Terms and conditions

We will count and evaluate how you contribute to the activities initiated by FOSSLK

We will evaluate what kind of impact your club is making the society. (We will use campus club log book as one of the data source)

The points count is determined by the FOSS Core team for each cause.

All the campus clubs in collaboration with FOSSLK will be eligible for this automatically.

The result will be displayed publicly for each year in the stars dashboard (TBD) and anyone can check it there.

You can schedule a call with FOSSLK to discuss how you can improve and achieve more. You are welcome for that for sure.

The result will be evaluated at the end of each year and gifts and appreciation will be awarded to the Campus club. The winners for each year will be displayed on the stars dashboard (TBD).

The amount of the points to be given and the decision is completely up to the FOSSLK core team and core team's decision will be the final decision.
